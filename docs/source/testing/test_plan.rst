*********
Test Plan
*********

This document is providing a test plan for Trustpoint
using the IEEE 829 standard for structuring this plan.

============
Introduction
============

The purpose of this test plan should be to test all required functions which are briefly described
inside the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/TrustPoint-Project/trustpoint>`_.
Also, there is a separation between functionality and user experience.
Since the project is heavily relying on securing networks as simple as possible,
the user experience should be as important as the functionality.

Summarized, this test plan is intended to ensure, through the execution and documentation of all tests, the

- functionality,
- usability,
- security and
- integration capability

of Trustpoint.
This is done by specifying and implementing the above-mentioned requirements in software tests.

.. _test-items-functions:

======================
Test Items (Functions)
======================

This chapter lists all needed requirements of Trustpoint, e.g. creating certificates.
These requirements are only back-end requirements.

====================
Software Risk Issues
====================

All software testing involves risks, which are listed below in order to minimize them.

- *Incomplete requirements:*
    As Trustpoint is a research project,
    it can happen that requirements are incomplete and only become apparent in retrospect that they would have been important.

- *Incomplete test coverage:*
    Although we strive to keep the test coverage as high as possible,
    sometimes not everything can be tested.
    As a result, some execution paths may be left out,
    with the resulting problems only becoming apparent during productive operation.

- *Lack of time for testing:*
    It could well happen that the test plan is too long and complex,
    so that we run out of time with the software tests.

- *Problems with the test environment:*
    Not every (automated) test can be carried out on a real environment.
    Therefore, simulation components are likely to be used,
    but these will probably not represent exactly the same devices as they will look like in the production environment.
    An example of this would be the simulation or integration of older machines which do not provide a certificate signed by the manufacturer.

- *User-friendliness:*
    The testers of the program's interface (acceptance testing) should be people with as little technical knowledge as possible,
    as otherwise the tests may give a false picture when tested by people from the development team.

- *Problems with manual testing:*
    We should thrive for automatic testing, although not every requirement can be tested automatically.
    That is, because the manual testing techniques are sometimes but not always the root of an error.

=====================
Features To Be Tested
=====================

This chapter lists all needed requirements of Trustpoint, e.g. creating certificates.
These requirements are now front-end requirements as well as user experience.
This is also the main difference between chapter :ref:`test-items-functions` and this chapter.
The `table of all actors <Trustpoint-Actors-Table>`_ is still used though.

.. csv-table:: Features To Be Tested

=========================
Features Not To Be Tested
=========================

There are no features present right now which we do not want to test.

===================
Approach (Strategy)
===================

--------------
Testing Levels
--------------

The testing will consist of Unit, System/Integration (combined), and Acceptance test levels.

^^^^^^^^^^^^
Unit Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unit testing will be conducted by the developers and approved by another developer.
Before unit testing is considered complete and the components are passed on for further testing,
developers must provide evidence of successful testing. This includes:

- A list of test cases executed
- Sample output
- Input data sets
- Documentation of identified and resolved defects

Note that this can be done automatically.

All unit test artifacts will also be shared with the test engineer for validation and record-keeping.
The focus of unit testing will be on verifying the functionality of individual modules of Trustpoint.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
System/Integration Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

System/Integration testing will be carried out by the test developer and the full development team.
The primary goal at this stage is to ensure that all Trustpoint modules work together seamlessly,
emphasizing interoperability, data consistency, and security.

Also, testing the software under high load and in a larger system should be performed. (Scalability)
(It could be the case that those tests are not feasible, because we cannot create such a broad testing environment.)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Acceptance Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Acceptance testing will be conducted by the end-users with assistance from the test manager or one of the developers.
This phase will focus on validating the Trustpoint systemâ€™s usability, reliability,
and alignment with user expectations in a production-like environment.
The testing process will involve:

- Evaluating user workflows,
- trust validation,
- and secure interactions to ensure the system meets all functional requirements.

Programs will enter acceptance testing only after all critical and major defects have been resolved.

Note that we are able to test user workflows automatically at the integration test phase
but there needs to be another acceptance test phase where we actually provide manual tests.

----------
Test Tools
----------

The testing for the Trustpoint project will utilize modern testing frameworks
and tools to ensure robust and efficient validation of the applicationâ€™s functionality across all levels.

^^^^^^^^^^^^
Unit Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unit testing for the core functionalities of Trustpoint will be implemented using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/>`_,
a widely adopted Python testing framework.
This ensures comprehensive and automated validation of the smallest testable units.
Tests will be integrated into the defined GitHub pipelines to enable continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).
These pipelines will ensure that any changes to the codebase are thoroughly tested before merging,
reducing the risk of regressions and enhancing development agility.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Integration/System Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Integration testing will leverage :term:`behave` to create :term:`BDD` test scenarios.
This approach will allow us to define tests in plain language
that are easy to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
The scenarios will focus on validating the interactions between Trustpoint components,
ensuring that they function cohesively as a system.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Acceptance Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tool for acceptance testing has not been finalized at this stage.
However, efforts are underway to evaluate suitable tools that align with the requirements of end-user testing.
In the interim, manual acceptance testing will be performed in collaboration with end users
to validate the system's readiness for production.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Data Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data for testing will primarily be sourced from production-like datasets
to simulate real-world scenarios effectively.
Where necessary, synthetic data will be generated or modified using Python-based utilities to ensure test completeness.
Under no circumstances will changes be made directly to actual production data during testing activities.

=======================
Item Pass/Fail Criteria
=======================

The test process for the Trustpoint project will be considered complete once the following criteria have been met:

#. Core Functionalities Validation:
    - All critical and major defects identified during unit, integration, and system testing must be resolved.
    - The core functionalities of Trustpoint, such as certificate issuance, renewal, revocation, and domain validation, must operate reliably without workarounds.

#. Integration Testing Success:
    - The PKI components must demonstrate seamless interaction, with no critical or major integration issues.
    - Simulated high-volume certificate management scenarios should execute without performance degradation or system crashes.

#. Acceptance Testing Completion:
    - The platform must pass acceptance testing by end users, ensuring it meets their operational requirements.
    - All critical and major defects discovered during this phase must be corrected, verified, and closed.

#. Data Integrity Verification:
    - Test data generated during the system/integration and acceptance phases must validate correctly against expected outcomes, ensuring the platformâ€™s reliability and accuracy in managing certificates.
    - Production-like scenarios must confirm data consistency across all Trustpoint modules.

#. PKI Compliance Validation:
    - Trustpointâ€™s processes must comply with PKI standards and security protocols.
    - Certificate data exchanges and storage must adhere to security best practices.

#. Deployment Readiness:
    - The system must pass GitHub pipeline tests, including automated unit and integration tests executed through pytest and :term:`behave`, with 100% of critical tests passing.
    - The staging environment must match the production setup, with successful parallel runs simulating live scenarios for a predefined period (e.g., two weeks).

Once these criteria are satisfied, Trustpoint will be considered ready for live deployment.
Following this, any additional configurations, user onboarding,
or domain activations will occur incrementally as per readiness and validation.

===============================================
Suspension Criteria And Resumption Requirements
===============================================

.. csv-table:: Suspension Criteria And Resumption Requirements
   :header: "Title", "Suspension", "Resumption"
   :widths: 30, 50, 50

    "Unavailability of CA or Domain Validation Services", "Testing will be paused if the certificate authority (CA) or domain validation services are unavailable, as these are critical for validating PKI-related functionalities.", "Testing will resume once the CA or validation services are operational, and any interrupted test cases will be re-executed to ensure completeness."
    "Critical Defect Identified in Core Functionality", "If a critical defect in core features (e.g., certificate issuance, revocation, or renewal) is identified during testing, further testing will be suspended until the issue is resolved.", "Testing will resume once the defect is fixed and verified in the development environment."
    "Test Environment Instability", "Testing will pause if the staging or testing environment becomes unstable or misconfigured, as this could lead to unreliable results.", "Testing will resume after the environment is restored to a stable and functional state, and necessary validations have been performed."
    "Unavailability of Required Test Data", "If critical test data (e.g., domain configurations, certificate requests) is unavailable or incomplete, testing will be suspended for the affected areas.", "Testing will resume once sufficient test data has been prepared and verified."
    "Staffing or Resource Constraints", "If key personnel (e.g., test managers or developers) or resources (e.g., access to tools or infrastructure) are unavailable, testing may be delayed for impacted areas.", "Testing will resume once adequate staffing and resources are available to continue the process effectively."

=================

==========
Test Cases
==========

Since we are using the :term:`BDD` principle for system and integration testing,
we decided on specifying the tests directly inside the :term:`Cucumber` feature files.
This has the advantage of removing the need to keep two or more documents updated at the same time.
Also, :term:`Gherkin` is a well organized language such that the test ideas and steps
are possible to read - even for people without a background in software engineering.
That being said, we state the feature files in the following and provide a brief description on the test ideas.

"""""""""
Test Idea
"""""""""

To test the requirement of creating, viewing, editing, and deleting digital identities using the TPC_Web interface,
the focus will be on validating the complete lifecycle of identity management through the web platform.

The test would start with an admin user creating a new digital identity through the web interface.
This process involves navigating to the appropriate page, filling out the required fields (e.g., name and identifier),
and submitting the form. Once the identity is created,
the test would verify that it appears in the list of identities and that all details are accurately displayed on its details page.

Following the creation, the admin user would edit the identity's details,
such as updating the name or identifier, and save the changes.
The test should confirm that the modifications are reflected immediately and correctly in both the details view and any listings.

Finally, the test would validate the deletion process,
where the admin removes the identity through the web interface.
Once deleted, the system should ensure that the identity is no longer accessible or visible in any lists or details pages.
Additional negative tests could confirm appropriate handling when attempting to access or manipulate a non-existent or already-deleted identity.

To test the complete lifecycle management of certificates,
the focus will be on ensuring that admin users can successfully perform actions such as renewing and revoking certificates via the TPC_Web interface.

The test begins by identifying an existing certificate.
Using TPC_Web, the admin initiates the renewal process,
and the system updates the expiration date.
Similarly, the admin navigates to the certificate management page and initiates a revocation process.
The system should confirm the action and reflect the certificate's updated status as revoked.

Edge cases include attempting to renew or revoke non-existent certificates or
performing actions on certificates in invalid states (e.g., already revoked certificates).
The system should handle these scenarios gracefully, with appropriate error messages or restrictions.

To test the REST API for interacting with Trustpoint programmatically,
we focus on verifying CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and additional actions like querying and filtering.
We begin by validating that authorized API clients can authenticate successfully and perform each operation on digital identities.
This includes creating a new identity,
retrieving its details, updating its attributes, and deleting it.
Each API response should include appropriate status codes and payloads.

Error handling should also be tested, such as attempting operations with invalid data,
unauthorized access, or on non-existent resources.
Edge cases, such as rate limits or concurrent requests, should be addressed to confirm robustness.

This requirement states that we want to distribute Trustpoint in a fully-configured Docker container.
The idea for testing would be to build the container,
run it on a production system and then check all other requirements manually or build a test suite and check the requirements automatically.
Since the code is the same, just executed in a Docker environment, we see no need to let those tests run automatically.
Therefore, we will pass the test for this requirement if the container can be built and ran on another system.

To verify the implementation of backup, restoration, and update mechanisms for ensuring system resilience:

#. Backup Verification:
    - An admin initiates a system backup via the TPC_Web interface.
    - The system confirms that the backup process completes successfully.
    - The backup file is retrievable and valid.

#. Restore Verification:
    - An admin uploads a valid backup file through the TPC_Web interface.
    - The system restores the data and confirms the restoration is successful.
    - Restored data is consistent with the backup file contents.

#. System Update Verification:
    - An admin triggers a system update via the TPC_Web interface.
    - The system downloads and applies the update.
    - Post-update, the system verifies the integrity and functionality of the application.

Edge cases include:

- Handling a corrupt backup file during restoration.
- Attempting to perform operations with insufficient admin privileges.

To verify that the system provides detailed and configurable logging for system events and actions,
we will test the following scenarios:

#. Logging of User Actions
    - The admin performs actions such as creating, updating, and deleting identities.
    - The system logs these actions with relevant details (timestamp, user ID, action type, and outcome).

#. Log Retrieval & Filtering
    - The admin retrieves system logs via the TPC_Web interface.
    - Logs can be filtered by time range, user, or event type.

#. Log Configuration Management
    - The admin modifies the logging configuration to change verbosity levels.
    - The system applies the new logging settings and updates log output accordingly.

#. Log Storage & Integrity
    - Logs are stored persistently and are not lost between system restarts.
    - Unauthorized users cannot modify or delete logs.

Edge cases:

- Verifying how the system handles an excessive number of log entries.
- Testing logging behavior when storage space is low.

To verify that the system automatically generates Issuing CAs based on configuration, we will test the following scenarios:

#. Successful Auto-Generation of an :term:`Issuing CA`
    - The admin configures the system with predefined settings for an :term:`Issuing CA`.
    - The system automatically generates the CA without manual intervention.
    - The CA appears in the list of available CAs.

#. Auto-Generation with Different Configurations
    - The admin sets different parameters for CA generation (e.g., key size, validity period).
    - The system creates the CA using the specified configuration.
    - The generated CA matches the given settings.

#. Failure Handling in CA Generation
    - The system prevents generation if required parameters are missing.
    - The system logs errors when CA generation fails.

#. Verification of Generated CA Details
    - The generated CA contains the expected attributes (issuer name, serial number, key usage, etc.).
    - The CA is functional and can issue end-entity certificates.

Edge cases:

- Attempting to generate a CA with invalid parameters.
- Generating multiple CAs in quick succession.

There is no High Availability Concept for Trustpoint yet,
so that the test needs to be redesigned after we decided on which concept top use.
For now, the test assumes a multi-server setup.

To verify that the system ensures high availability through redundancy and failover mechanisms,
we will test the following scenarios:

#. Failover Mechanism Activation
    - Simulate a primary server failure.
    - Verify that the system seamlessly switches to a secondary server.
    - Ensure no data loss or service interruption.

#. Load Balancing Under High Traffic
    - Simulate multiple concurrent users accessing the system.
    - Verify that traffic is distributed across multiple nodes.
    - Ensure response times remain within acceptable limits.

#. Recovery After a Server Crash
    - Simulate a server crash and restart.
    - Ensure the system restores its previous state without manual intervention.
    - Verify that logs and transactions remain intact.

#. Database Replication Consistency
    - Ensure that database replication maintains consistency across multiple nodes.
    - Test whether changes made on one node propagate to others correctly.

Edge cases:

- Sudden simultaneous failure of multiple components.
- Failover switching back to the primary server after recovery.
- Performance degradation during failover.
