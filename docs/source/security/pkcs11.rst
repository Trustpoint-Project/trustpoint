HSM Integration in Trustpoint
=============================

Overview
--------

Trustpoint integrates with Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) through the PKCS#11 standard to provide secure key storage and cryptographic operations. 

Supported HSM Types
-------------------

SoftHSM
~~~~~~~

**Primary Support**: SoftHSM2 is the default and fully supported HSM implementation.

- **Library Path**: ``/usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so``
- **Use Case**: Development, testing, and small-scale production deployments

Physical HSM
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Future Support**: Physical HSM devices are planned for production environments.

- **Status**: Interface defined but not fully implemented
- **Use Case**: High-security production deployments

Supported Cryptographic Operations
-----------------------------------

RSA Key Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Key Generation**:
- RSA key pair generation within HSM
- Supported key sizes: 2048, 3072, 4096 bits
- Keys marked as non-extractable for security

**Signing Operations**:
- RSA-PSS padding support
- PKCS#1 v1.5 padding support
- Supported hash algorithms: SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-224
- Pre-hashed data signing capability

**Encryption/Decryption Operations**:
- RSA-OAEP padding support for encryption/decryption
- PKCS#1 v1.5 padding support
- Public key extraction for certificate generation

**Key Import**:
- Import existing RSA private keys from cryptography library to HSM
- Keys stored as non-extractable in HSM

EC (Elliptic Curve) Key Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Key Generation**:
- EC key pair generation within HSM
- Supported curves: P-256, P-384, P-521, secp256k1
- Curve parameter validation

**Signing Operations**:
- ECDSA signature generation
- Supported hash algorithms: SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
- Data is hashed before signing (pre-hashed data not supported)
- ASN.1 DER encoded signatures
- Mechanism mapping: ECDSA_SHA256, ECDSA_SHA384, ECDSA_SHA512

**Key Management**:
- Named curve support via OID mapping
- Public key point extraction
- Key import from cryptography library to HSM
- Keys marked as non-extractable (EXTRACTABLE=False)
- Encryption/decryption not supported (EC is for signing only)

AES Key Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Symmetric Key Generation**:
- AES key generation in HSM
- Supported key lengths: 128, 192, 256 bits
- Primary use for KEK storage

**Encryption/Decryption Operations**:
- AES-ECB encryption for DEK wrapping
- DEK wrapping and unwrapping operations
- Note: AES Key Wrap (RFC 3394) not supported by SoftHSM2
- 8-byte random IV prepended to encrypted data for format consistency

General HSM Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Token Management**:
- Token initialization and configuration
- Slot enumeration and selection
- Token authentication with PIN

**Session Management**:
- Session creation and termination
- User authentication
- Session state management

**Object Management**:
- Key object creation and destruction
- Object attribute management
- Label-based key retrieval

**Random Number Generation**:
- Uses OS-level randomness (``os.urandom()``) for DEK generation
- SoftHSM provides cryptographically secure random generation
- Used for nonce/IV generation in encryption operations

**Digest Operations**:
- Hardware-accelerated hashing via HSM
- Supported algorithms: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
- Mechanism mapping: SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512

Key Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Trustpoint Container**:
- Django application with HSM integration
- SoftHSM with token storage
- DEK caching for database encryption

**Docker Infrastructure**:
- Secure PIN management via Docker secrets
- Persistent token storage via Docker volumes
- Separate database container with encrypted fields

**Key Management**:
- KEK stored in HSM, marked as non-extractable (SENSITIVE=True, EXTRACTABLE=False)
- DEK wrapped by KEK using AES-ECB, cached at startup
- Database fields encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Token-specific cache keys: ``trustpoint-dek-chache-{token_label}``

Docker Integration

Container Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Trustpoint container includes pre-configured SoftHSM support with token directory and configuration file setup. HSM PINs are managed through Docker secrets for secure credential handling.

**Docker Compose Secrets**:

````yaml
secrets:
  hsm_pin:
    file: hsm_pin.txt
  hsm_so_pin:
    file: hsm_so_pin.txt

environment:
  HSM_PIN_FILE: /run/secrets/hsm_pin
  HSM_SO_PIN_FILE: /run/secrets/hsm_so_pin
